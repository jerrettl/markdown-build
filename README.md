# Markdown Building Resources

This project is largely taken from the work done in the [cs-materials](https://github.com/wikiknights/cs-materials) project. An issue with this project is that the system used to build Markdown files into others (e.g. PDF) is somewhat purpose-built and is hard to generalize for use on, for example, one-off projects. This repository intends to resolve this by aggregating the resources for building Markdown files into one location.

For the time being, these files are provided as-is, but the goal is to add more documentation for general use.

## Usage

**Note:** These tools are currently only intended to be used on a Linux-based operating system.

Use the `initialize.sh` script to add the Markdown build tools to your PATH.

- `md-convert` allows you to convert one Markdown file.
- `md-build-all` allows you to convert all Markdown files within a single directory.
